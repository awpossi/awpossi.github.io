    <h1>Andrew Possi</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a data analyst with a background in finance and sports analytics. I earned my Bachelor's in Finance from UMass Dartmouth, 
        and I'm currently completing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at Tulane University. My tools include R, Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, 
        which I use to solve real-world problems and tell compelling stories through data.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've worked with the Tampa Bay Rays and Tulane Baseball, and I’ve built projects in predictive modeling, injury risk analytics, 
        player performance forecasting, credit risk evaluation, and player evaluation. Below are a few of my favorite projects.
    </p>

    <h2>📊 Project Portfolio</h2>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>🏈 2025 Fantasy Football Injury Case Study (PMG Model)</h3>
        <p>
            This project introduces a new stat: Projected Missed Games (PMG), which estimates injury risk based on prior history, volume, and positional contact. 
            It's designed to inform fantasy football draft decisions. Uses Mike Clay's 2025 Projections for future data and statistics from the 2024 season.

        <h3>⚾ SABR 2025 Pitch Decay Presentation</h3>
        <p>
            Presented at the SABR Analytics Conference, this project explores how pitch decay (loss of effectiveness as a pitch is repeated to a batter throughout the game) impacts starting pitchers. 
            Uses Statcast data and game outcomes to suggest new approaches to in-game management.

            Built new metrics — Save Score and Reliever Impact Score — to evaluate MLB relievers more effectively than traditional stats. 
            Project uses Statcast data and regression modeling to forecast impact.
